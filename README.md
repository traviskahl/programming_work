# programming_work
A set of scattered programming exercises and tutorials that I've completed.
This repository holds most, if not all, of my programming exercises.
If you are hoping to better gauge my programming skill, the folder in cpp/learncpp has lots of completed content.
If you're using this as an aid to your own programming lessons, I hope you find my work clear and helpful.
It should be noted that any compiled programs were compiled for 64-bit Linux. If you use 32-bit Linux, they may not work.
If you use Windows, they WILL not work and you may need to compile them yourself.
Any interpreted languages, such as Python or Bash, will most likely work on any architecture.
