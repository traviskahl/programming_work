each object can have a material that reacts differently to light
great for giving objects unique looks compared to other objects
not great for flexibility with visual output

most of the time objects aren't a single material but rather several
a car has an exterior of paint, windows that partially reflect light, tires aren't shiny so don't have specular highlights
also has diffuse and ambient colors that aren't the same for each material

our previous system isn't usable for anything except the simplest models
we need to extend it by introducing diffuse and specular maps
let us influence diffuse and specular components with more precision

we want to set the diffuse color for each individual fragment
where we can retrieve a color value based on its position on an object
it's textures, we want to use textures
it's the same principle: use an image wrapped around an object that we can index for unique color values per fragment
in lighted scenes it's called a diffuse map
since a texture image represents all of the objects diffuse colors

using a diffuse map is the same as textures
however we store it as a sampler2D inside the Material struct
replace the diffuse vec3 with diffuse map

we'll need texture coords again in fragment shader so we have another input variable
then we sample from the texture to get its diffuse color value
set ambient material color to diffuse color as well
and we're good to go

we need to update vertex data with texture coords
has vertex positions, normal vectors, and texture coords

as is the specular highlight looks off
the wood is reflecting light, but it really shouldn't
we could set specular material of that object to vec3(0.0)
but the steel also wouldn't show specular highlights, which it should

we can use a texture map for specular highlights
we need a black and white texture that defines specular intensities for each part of the object
intensity of specular hightlight is retrieved by brightness of each pixel
the closer to white a pixel is, the higher its specular component

all of the parts that are wood are converted to black in our specular map
since it should have no specular highlights
can use photoshop or gimp to make them

a specular map is like any other texture so code is similar to diffuse map code
load the image and generate a texture object
we need to use a different texture unit
update material properties of fragment shader to accept a sampler2D as specular component
then sample specular map to retrieve fragment's corresponding specular intensity

with specular maps we can get lots of detail
now our object looks more like an actual wood container
we can also use other texture maps
like a normal/bump map or a reflection map
