all lighting so far has been from one source
in reality we have multiple that act differently
light source that casts light onto objects is called a light caster
there's a few different types

when a light source is far away the light rays are almost parallel to each other
when a light source is infinitely far away it's a directional light
because all light rays have the same direction
for example, the sun
not really infinitely far away, but might as well be
all light rays are parallel

since they're parallel doesn't matter how an object relates to the source's position
since direction stays the same, calculations will be similar for each object
model one by defining a light direction vector instead of a position vector
should negate it because it's traveling towards an object, not away from
