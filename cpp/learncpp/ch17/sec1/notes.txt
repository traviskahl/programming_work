lots of programs use the same things
rewriting these containers, algorithms, etc. leads to errors
CPP comes with a library with lots of reusable classes
called the Standard Template Library: STL

a collection of classes that provide templated containers, algorithms, and iterators
if you need a commonly used algorithm or container, STL probably has it
it's good because we can reuse this code and is pretty efficient
it can be bad because it's very complex
