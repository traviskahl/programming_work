STL also gives us some generic algorithms to work with container classes
lets us search, sort, insert, reorder, remove, copy, etc.
implemented as global functions using iterators
only need to implemented once, usually works for all containers with iterators, even custom ones
however it might not work with some containers, give us infinite loops, or perform poorly
use them by including algorithm header

min_element() and max_element() find the greatest and least values in a container

EX: minmax.cpp

this example uses find() to find a value then uses list::insert() to add a new value at that point

EX: find.cpp

we can sort a vector and reverse it

EX: sort.cpp

sort() doesn't work on list container classes
they have their own function which is actually more efficient
