input and output isn't part of c++ but is part of standard library
is in std namespace

when we include iostream header we get many classes that have io functionality
uses this hierarchy

				ios_base
				    ^
				   ios
			       ^ ^
		istream 				ostream
		(input) 				(output)
          ^     ^                ^    ^
istream_withassign   iostream		ostream_withassign
		(cin)                        (cout, cerr, clog)
                        ^
					iostream_withassign


this hierarchy uses multiple inheritance, even though it's usually avoided
iostream library has been extensively tested to avoid typical problems

io in c++ is implemented with streams
stream: a sequence of characters that can be accessed sequentially
can produce or consume an infinite amount of data

input streams are used to hold input from a data producer
can be keyboard, file, network, etc
user might press key while program isn't expecting any input
instead of ignoring it, data is put in input stream until it can be used

output streams are used to hold output for a data consumer
monitor, file, printer, etc.
device might not be ready to accept the data yet
printer might be warming up when program writes data to output stream
data sits in output stream until printer begins consuming it

some devices like files and networks are capable of being both input and output sources

we only need to learn how to interact with streams in order to read them
how they actually work doesn't really matter to us

ios is the most base class we'll work with
ios class defines things that are common to both input and output streams

istream class is primary class used for input 
extraction operator >> is used to remove values
when user presses key, key code is placed in an input stream
program then extracts it to use it

ostream is primary class used for output streams
insertion operator << is used to put values in the stream
you insert values to the stream, consumer uses them

iostream can handle both input and output
bidirectional io

some classes that end with _withassign
derived from istream, ostream, and iostream
allow you to assign one stream to another using assignment operator

standard streams are preconnected streams provided by a program to the environment
c++ comes with four predefined streams that we can use
	cin: istream_withassign tied to standard input
	cout: ostream_withassign tied to the standard output
	cerr: ostream_withassign tied to standard error with unbuffered output
	clog: ostream_withassign tied to standard error with buffered output

example: basic.cpp
