1) Explain when you should use the following types of pointers.

1a) std::unique_ptr
	You should use this when a resource should be managed by only one owner.

1b) std::shared_ptr
	You should use this when one resource should be managed by multiple smart pointers.

1c) std::weak_ptr
	You should use this when you want to prevent circular references caused by std::shared_ptr.

1d) std::auto_ptr
	You should never use this. In C++17, it's not even possible to use it.
