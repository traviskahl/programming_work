many programs use the same concepts over and over
loops, strings, arrays, sorting, etc.
writing programs using non-class versions of containers and algorithms can have many errors

c++ comes with a library with many reusable classes for us to build programs with
called the c++ standard template library (STL)
it's a collection of classes that have templated containers, algorithms, and iterators
if we need a common class or algorithm, STL probably has it
we can use these without needing to write the classes ourselves
all the classes are reasonably efficient
however the STL is fairly complex and might be intimidating since everything is templated

we can engage the STL in small parts and ignore the rest until we need it
