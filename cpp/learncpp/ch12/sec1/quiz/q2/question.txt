2) Why is the above solution non-optimal?

Hint: Think about the future state of Cat and Dog where we want to differentiate Cats and Dogs in more ways.
Hint: Think about the ways in which having a member that needs to be set at initialization limits you.

The solution is non-optimal because if we want to make Cats and Dogs different in more ways, we have to add more literals.
The user isn't able to specify what they want to have their Cat or Dog say, at least not in this implementation.
If we want to add another characteristic to differentiate them, we'll need to make our initializer list
longer and longer.
