1) Our Animal/Cat/Dog example above doesn’t work like we want because a reference or pointer to an Animal can’t access the derived version of speak() needed to return the right value for the Cat or Dog. One way to work around this issue would be to make the data returned by the speak() function accessible as part of the Animal base class (much like the Animal’s name is accessible via member m_name).

Update the Animal, Cat, and Dog classes in the lesson above by adding a new member to Animal named m_speak. Initialize it appropriately. The following program should work properly:
	
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Cat fred("Fred"), misty("Misty"), zeke("Zeke");
    Dog garbo("Garbo"), pooky("Pooky"), truffle("Truffle");
 
    // Set up an array of pointers to animals, and set those pointers to our Cat and Dog objects
    Animal *animals[] = { &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke };
    for (int iii=0; iii < 6; iii++)
        std::cout << animals[iii]->getName() << " says " << animals[iii]->speak() << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
