in the past we overloaded operator+ as a friend function
it's convenient because we get direct access to internal members of the classes we're operating on
but if we don't need that access we can write overloaded operators as normal functions
our Cents class has an access function to get the data member we need
so our overloaded operator+ can be written as a non-friend

EX: normal.cpp

normal and friend functions function almost identically, just with different access levels
the one difference is that friend function inside class is also a prototype
with normal function we need to have our own function prototype

EX: cents.h
	cents.cpp
	main.cpp

in general normal functions should be preferred over friend functions
as long as you can do so with the existing functions
don't add additional access functions to overload an operator as a normal as opposed to a friend

Rule: prefer overloading operators as normal functions instead of friends if it's possible to
	do so without adding additional functions.
