1) Write a class that holds a string. Overload operator() to return the substring that starts at the index of the first parameter. The length of the substring should be defined by the second parameter.

Hint: You can use array indices to access individual chars within the std::string
Hint: You can use operator+= to append something to a string

The following code should run:
int main()
{
    Mystring string("Hello, world!");
    std::cout << string(7, 5); // start at index 7 and return 5 characters
 
    return 0;
}
This should print

world
