Take the Fraction class we wrote in the previous quiz (listed below) and add an overloaded operator<< and operator>> to it.

The following program should compile:
int main()
{
 
	Fraction f1;
	std::cout << "Enter fraction 1: ";
	std::cin >> f1;
 
	Fraction f2;
	std::cout << "Enter fraction 2: ";
	std::cin >> f2;
 
	std::cout << f1 << " * " << f2 << " is " << f1 * f2 << '\n';
 
	return 0;
}
And produce the result:
Enter fraction 1: 2/3
Enter fraction 2: 3/8
2/3 * 3/8 is 1/4
