1a) Write a class named Fraction that has a integer numerator and denominator member. Write a print() function that prints out the fraction.

The following code should compile:

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Fraction f1(1, 4);
    f1.print();
 
    Fraction f2(1, 2);
    f2.print();
}

This should print:

1/4
1/2

1b) Add overloaded multiplication operators to handle multiplication between a Fraction and integer, and between two Fractions. Use the friend function method.

Hint: To multiply two fractions, first multiply the two numerators together, and then multiply the two denominators together. To multiply a fraction and an integer, multiply the numerator of the fraction by the integer and leave the denominator alone.

The following code should compile:
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Fraction f1(2, 5);
    f1.print();
 
    Fraction f2(3, 8);
    f2.print();
 
    Fraction f3 = f1 * f2;
    f3.print();
 
    Fraction f4 = f1 * 2;
    f4.print();
 
    Fraction f5 = 2 * f2;
    f5.print();
 
    Fraction f6 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(2, 3) * Fraction(3, 4);
    f6.print();
}
This should print:

2/5
3/8
6/40
4/5
6/8
6/24

1c) Extra credit: the fraction 2/4 is the same as 1/2, but 2/4 is not reduced to the lowest terms. We can reduce any given fraction to lowest terms by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) between the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The following is a function to find the GCD:
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

Add this function to your class, and write a member function named reduce() that reduces your fraction. Make sure all fractions are properly reduced.

The following should compile:
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Fraction f1(2, 5);
    f1.print();
 
    Fraction f2(3, 8);
    f2.print();
 
    Fraction f3 = f1 * f2;
    f3.print();
 
    Fraction f4 = f1 * 2;
    f4.print();
 
    Fraction f5 = 2 * f2;
    f5.print();
 
    Fraction f6 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(2, 3) * Fraction(3, 4);
    f6.print();
 
    return 0;
}
And produce the result:

2/5
3/8
3/20
4/5
3/4
1/4
