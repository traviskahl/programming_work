# cpp
A set of C++ programs written and compiled for 64-bit Linux.
The folder titled "learncpp" has a great amount of work I have completed.
The folder titled "opengl" contains programs written using OpenGL. If you want to see OpenGL programs written entirely by me,
please refer to the folder titled "opengl" in the main directory.
