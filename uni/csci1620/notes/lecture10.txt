Lecture 10: Exception Handling I

two types of errors
compile time errors, easy to find and fix
run time errors
	happen when something unwanted happens
	known as Exceptions

exception output is called the stack trace
specific line is called the throw point

not always possible to stop exceptions from occurring
possible for forsee and handle exceptions

exceptions are classes
when an exception is thrown, it's throwing objects

to handle an exception, must be declared where the exception might occur
do this with a try block
// try { doSomething(); }

a catch block determines what exception should be caught and what to do with it
multiple exceptions can be handled with one try block

try {
	// code here
}
catch(InputMismatchException IME) {
	// what to do if exception happens
}

can have multiple catch blocks for one try blocks
use System.err stream for printing errors, will always print

exceptions inherit from the Exception class
can catch a general Exception

when an exception is thrown in a try block, nothing else is done
checks catch blocks and executes appropriate one
if there isn't one, program crashes and prints stack trace

try block + catch block + finally block (sometimes) make a try statement
