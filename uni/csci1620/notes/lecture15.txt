Lecture 15: ArrayList

data structure: logical structure that can be used to store and organize data
typically same type
different data structures organize data in different ways and provide the appropriate methods to manipulate data unique to structure

array is simplest data structure
can store data
manipulate individual pieces of data
get length of array, etc

can't natively sort, search, remove, add, swap, etc
need to write our own code
size can't be changed either

ArrayList is essentially an array
gives us ability to manipulate data through member methods
easy interface for common array manipulations
can be either a sorted or unsorted list

public class ArrayList {
	private int[] list;
	private int numElements;
	// methods here
}

list: group of related items with a linear relationship
linear relationship: each element except first has a unique predecessor, each element except last has unique successor

data members: the array itself, number of elements, original size, default and maximum sizes which are final
public methods: constructor with size parameter, add item, remove item, find item, get length, clear the array, etc.
private method: enlarge
makes array larger when it's full
called by addItem
private since user shouldn't be able to arbitrarily increase size, only needed when array's full

problem: can only hold one type of data, need to rewrite for another data type
