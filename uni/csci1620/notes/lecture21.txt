Lecture 21: Files part II

can serialize objects, write an entire object to a file
object must implement Serializable
all data members must be Serializable
all primitives and arrays are Serializable
some reference types are, check definitions
serialized objects are stored in .ser files

can label data member transient
will be skipped in serialization
becomes null reference

ObjectOutputStream class does serialization and writes to files
takes FileOutputStream class as a parameter
// output = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("filename.ser"));
// output.writeObject(objectName);
// output.close(); // need to close it as well

ObjectInputStream class gets serialized inputs and deserializes it
takes FileInputStream class
// input.readObject(); // get an object, returns an Object, need to cast
throws EOFException when no objects are left, can use to stop reading
