# arch
A set of procedures and commands I used to install Arch Linux.
I wrote them down here so I wouldn't forget them, since the process changes for every computer.
If you want to use what's here to install Arch on you own system, please feel free.
However, if something doesn't go right, please consult the Arch Wiki.
